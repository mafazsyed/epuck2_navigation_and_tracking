# e-puck2 Adaptive Navigation and Object Tracking
Contains the implementation of adaptive control strategies for the e-puck2 robot for autonomous navigation and object tracking.

**Task 1:** Environment Exploration, Autonomous Navigation, and Obstacle Avoidance

**Task 2:** Object Tracking/Following and Collosion Avoidance

**Extension:**
- Generation of a localised heatmap environment visualisation using IR sensor readings and an LuT.
- Use of built-in LED lights, green and red, to indicate whether an object is in vicinity for action.

The aim of the project extension was to implement visuals to attract students at a University open day.
